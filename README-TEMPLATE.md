This project will do this thing that I am describing.

## Prerequisites

* [Github Account](https://www.github.com/)

2. Run the following bash commands to test your changes.

```bash
sh ./tools_platform/infrastructure.sh
```

3. If you wish to try deploying to development from your gitpod directory exactly as the pipeline would, runL:

```bash
sh ./tools_platform/infrastructure.sh True
```

1. You can either manually trigger the github action associated with this repo, which will deploy to development and generate a plan against production.
1. A pull request to main will trigger the github action associated with this repo, which will deploy to development and generate a plan against production.
